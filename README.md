# Blitz Scouter
## What is this?
This is the GitHub repository for New Berlin Blitz's scouting app. It utilizes a data connection to send data from an app to a google sheet in order to compile large amounts of data about other robots.

## 2019 Season
During the 2019 Season, the scouting app is in-browser so it can support most operating systems. The app will be developed via ASP.NET MVC to send data to a server (which will also host the website) which collects and converts data to a google sheet which is used to break down the data per robot.

## TODO
- Fix Google Drive Uploader
- Add robot profile pages
